# Etherum Key Scanner

<p>
This is a primative tool for checking the balances of etherum or erc20/71 wallets. It takes a list of etherum private keys and uses the etherscan 
api to check the balance after deriving the public key. I just realized that it should probably also be able to accept a list of public keys directly 
so I will add that functionality soon. This method of checking is probably not ideal as the API is slow. A better way would be to run an etherum node 
locally and use the RPC. But this is convenient if the list you need to check is not super long.
